# This repo has been created with the aim of documenting the solution to challenges on most competitive programming platforms using the [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language

## How to use:
The solution to each challenge is stored on it's own branch and is named like so:
- "WEBSITE"-"PROBLEM#"
For example, the "Age Limit" problem on [CodeChef](https://codechef.com) has the problem code "AGELIMIT", therefore to find the solution you need, do the following:
1. Click the "Go To File" button on github
2. In the searchbar, type in "codechef-AGELIMIT"
3. Click on the result that shows.
Voila!, you're all set.

Use this method to find any solutions you may be looking for and they, if it exists, the corresponding file will be shown
